| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**    | The system follows a client-server architecture with a Node.js backend and a MongoDB database. It uses Express.js for the server implementation and Mongoose for MongoDB operations. The WebSocket server handles real-time communication with clients. The system adopts a monolithic architecture where all components are tightly coupled. There are separate controller classes for different entities like articles, authentication, configuration, and notifications. Controllers and services handle the business logic, and external libraries like ImageKit and Redis are integrated for image upload and caching. |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The quality and comprehensiveness of documentation cannot be determined from the codebase alone. However, comments in the code are relevant, providing explanations for the purpose and functionality of different sections. JSDoc-style comments are used in some files to document interfaces and types. The README file is available and provides basic information about installing and running the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The system relies on several dependencies listed in the package.json file, including Express.js, Mongoose, ImageKit, Redis, JWT, Multer, and others. These libraries provide essential features for building and running the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is reasonably modular in terms of controllers, services, and utilities. Each controller is responsible for separate functionality and follows the Single Responsibility Principle. Services encapsulate specific business functionalities and can be easily replaced or extended. The utils folder contains common decorators, interfaces, and resolver functions used by different components. However, further modular improvements could be made, such as separating concerns into different modules or microservices for better scalability and isolation.                                                 |
| **✔️ Testing**         | The codebase does not include dedicated testing files or test frameworks. It lacks automated unit tests and integration tests. Implementing testing strategies and tools like Jest, Mocha, or Supertest could significantly enhance code quality and maintainability. The lack of tests may increase the risk of regression bugs and hinder collaboration during development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **⚡️ Performance**    | Performance characteristics cannot be assessed from the codebase alone. However, potential areas for performance optimizations include caching, leveraging Redis for frequent retrievals, using HTTP/2 or WebSockets for efficient data transfer, and implementing database indexing for faster queries. Performance profiling and load testing would be necessary to identify bottlenecks and fine-tune the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase incorporates several security measures. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and protection of routes through decorators. Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database, reducing the risk of credential exposure. The system enforces secure practices like input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities. However, a more thorough security assessment and additional measures like input/output validation, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling would further improve the system's security.                                        |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase has a git repository hosted on GitHub. It utilizes branches for different features or bug fixes, and commits are reasonably well-structured. The repository includes a pre-commit hook that ensures code formatting and enforces linting rules before commits are made, helping                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [controller.decorator.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/mapnews-backend/blob/main/src/utils/decorators/controller.decorator.ts)         | This code exports a function named `Controller` that is used as a TypeScript decorator. It attaches metadata to a target class by storing a dynamic base path for API routing. The base path is determined by concatenating "/api/v1" with a passed `basePath` parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [handlers.decorator.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/mapnews-backend/blob/main/src/utils/decorators/handlers.decorator.ts)             | This code exports decorators for "GET" and "POST" HTTP methods, which can be used to define routes for a router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [authentication.decorator.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/mapnews-backend/blob/main/src/utils/decorators/authentication.decorator.ts) | This code is an authorization decorator that verifies JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for protected routes. It extracts the token from the request headers, decodes it using a JWT secret code, and then checks if the token is valid. If the token is valid, it attaches the user attribute to the request body. Otherwise, if the route is whitelisted, the code bypasses the token validation and allows access. The decorator can be applied to any function/method within a class to enforce authentication before execution. |
| [cache.decorator.ts](https://github.com/dubstep-warrior/mapnews-backend/blob/main/src/utils/decorators/cache.decorator.ts)                   | The code defines a caching decorator that retrieves data from a Redis cache. If the data is found, it's returned; if not, the original function is called, and the data is stored in Redis before it's returned. If bypass conditions are met, the cache is bypassed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
